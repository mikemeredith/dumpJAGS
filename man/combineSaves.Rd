\title{
Combine MCMC samples from files
}
\description{
Takes a list of files which contain output from \code{\link{saveJAGS}}, loads them into R and combines into a single \code{\link{mcmc.list}} object.
}
\usage{
combineSaves(fileList, params=NULL, thin=1, burnFiles=0, cores=1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fileList}{
a list of file names as returned by \code{saveJAGS} or \code{recoverSaves}.
}
  \item{params}{
a character vector giving the names of variables to be retained; if NULL, all will be retained.
}
  \item{thin}{
the amount of additional thinning to be applied to the chains when read in.
}
  \item{burnFiles}{
the number of initial files to discard as burn-in.
}
  \item{cores}{
the maximum number of cores (threads) to use; the number used is the minimum of (a) \code{cores}, (b) the number of chains to process, (c) the number of cores available on the machine. Parallel processing uses more memory and may fail if files are very large.
}
}

\value{
An object of class \code{mcmc.list}.
