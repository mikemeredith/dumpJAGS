  * Added checks for JAGS errors in `resumeJAGS`.

CHANGES in 0.0.4.9001 (2020-06-19)

  * Fixed bug in `saveJAGS` when handling `inits` functions with no `chain` argument.

CHANGES in 0.0.4 (2020-05-10)

  * `recoverSaves` can now cope with '_' in `fileStub`.

  * Fixed bugs in `summary` due to integer overflow and showing KB instead of GB.

  * Improvements to outputs of `summary`.

  * Added method to convert file list to `mcmcOutput` class; package now depends on `mcmcOutput` package.

  * Replaced `combineSaves` with a method for `as.mcmc.list`

  * `saveJAGS` now works with missing or NULL inits.

  * Chain identifiers changed to 2-letter combinations, AA to ZZ; limit of 26 chains raised to 26^2 = 676 (wish of Wyatt Petersen).

  * Improved reporting of JAGS errors.
  _not fully tested_, need JAGS to throw errors for that.

  * Default for `fileStub` removed, user must specify path.

  * `summary.saveJAGSfileList` reports if adaptation was adequate and shows median time taken to create a file.

  * added functions `getModel` and `getData` to get information on the run.

  * `combineSaves` gains a `cores` argument and allows parallel processing.

  * fixed bug in `combineSaves` when used after `resumeJAGS`.

  * `summary.saveJAGSfileList` now returns a vector with the parameter names.

  * added `resumeJAGS` function.

  * file IDs now use 3 digits with leading zeros

  * `recoverSaves` checks for duplicate A_1 or A_001 files and ensures chains are same length

  * file lists produced by `saveJAGS` and `recoverSaves` have class `saveJAGSfileList`; there is a `summary` method for this.

  * `saveJAGS` uses the L'Ecuyer random number generator.

  * `combineSaves` gains `params` and `thin` arguments

  * Changed names from `dump...` to `save...`

  * `simsList` can now deal with ragged arrays
